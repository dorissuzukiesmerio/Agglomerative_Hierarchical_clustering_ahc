# # Clustering methods:

# GMM - more assumptions about the data generating process

# Kmededois - worse in silhouette score, but better in other matters 

# That is : tradeoffs

# _____

# Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (ahc)

# > New family 
# > Natural way of determining number of clusters. 


# AUTOMATION:

###
1. Begins with 1 cluster = 1 dot
2. Goes to 1 cluster = group closest clusters together
repeat

## Interpreting the dandrogram : 

# Good no matter how many dimensions
# Dendrogram is consistent with using the 

# AHC : computationally faster -
